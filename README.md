# VSCode Ayu Themes.
This is a repository with the ayu themes for Vs Code. Although already accessible at the official ayu repository, they are not in a format that can be used with the [code theme converter](https://github.com/tobiastimm/code-theme-converter). This repository is one that can be used to convert the Vs Code themes to themes for any JetBrains IDE or Sublime Text.
